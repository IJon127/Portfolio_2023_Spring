The pregnancy process typically lasts 38-40 weeks and is divided into three trimesters. Key milestones include heartbeat detection as early as week 6 and the fetus doubling in size by week 8. Screening tests, such as ultrasound and blood testing, can detect early signs of Down syndrome between weeks 10 and 14. Diagnostic tests like amniocentesis are conducted between weeks 15 and 20 to confirm any abnormalities. Gestational diabetes may develop after week 20, which can lead to high blood pressure, a larger baby, and potential complications like preeclampsia.",

As women age, the quality of their eggs declines, and pregnancy risks increase. These risks include preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature birth, low birth weight, expecting twins, miscarriage, Down syndrome, and other genetic disorders, as well as the likelihood of cesarean section or stillbirth."

However, in terms of actual interaction instead of visual or virtual participation, it is much more difficult to create public engagement in any built urban environment. The more designers and architects put effort into applying complicated algorithms and mechanisms to interactive items, the more it shows that the majority of our surroundings, by its default status, do not interact with people at all.",

From a cognitive psychological point of view, the “imaging” of cities is a form of cognitive mapping: Because of the limitation of cognitive capacity, our brains naturally filter secondary information or background noises to cope with overwhelming information. The imagery in ACAITL represents the selective mechanism in terms of perceiving and conceiving urban spatial information through a three- step procedure— “Documentation”, “Coding”, and “Projection”."

A rather complicated coding pattern is established to carefully assign contrasting colors to different groups of visual elements, in order to create overlapping addition of lights. A car would be projected in red and yellow from one projector, as well as cyan and blue from another. If one is to move in front of the two projectors, the car would be seen as white first (no shadow), and then either red or blue (alternative shadows), depending on the relative locations of the viewer blocking the lights."

This layered visuals await for involvement from participants. When one step in front of one of the projections, the shadow of the person, instead of appearing black for lack of light, unexpectedly reveals the highly contrasted shapes of saturated colors coming from the directions of other projectors. In a sense, this is a “decoding” process, highlighting some of the layers of urban information by blocking the light that “conceals” the colors.

        "New York City, a bustling metropolis nestled in the northern region of the United States, is known for its chilly winters and frequent snowfall. When the snow covers the city, snow-melt salt is indispensable for winter life and keeps the streets and sidewalks available. However, the amount of salt used for deicing roads and highways is often overused, which causes damage to roads and other infrastructure that need to be repaired annually. Additionally, the massive amount of salt often infiltrates the surrounding soil and water systems, causing severe environmental issues and compromising the natural resources in the city.",
        "The idea comes from the need to reduce the overuse of snow-melt salt in New York City during the winter months or use alternative organic salt. The project is a concrete stool with a light underneath that illuminates through road salt. The stool is made of 50 lbs of high-strength concrete mix and plywood for the mold. The road salt is filled with the fissures of concrete. The light design functions to illuminate the surrounding of the stool, and the refraction from salt will create a unique and visually appealing effect. This stool will serve as a reflection of the exaggerated usage of road salt during the winter months and the need to be mindful of environmental impact."

        "Ibrijomeesean Library is a multiplayer competitive board game modified from the classic counting game, snakes and ladders. Players play roles as ambitious students in a race against their classmates to finish all of their reading assignments. The first student to check out all three of their research subjects and research them to completion wins!Each student must navigate the library and collect books for their three research subjects. Roll the dice to determine how you move or read!"

        "Earthquakes, typhoons and volcanoes constantly ravage coastal regions around the globe. Countless schools take the brunt of this destructive force, but simultaneously act as emergency operation centers and shelters after the disaster. Unfortunately, the collapse of this infrastructure hinders relief operations. In response to this potentially dire situation, we’ve developed a new system which can be quickly constructed with on-hand materials and readily transported to damaged environments.",
        "Often the stricken area is inaccessible by vehicles, so aid organizations airdrop relief supplies by helicopter. Our design incorporates the containers and other transportation materials (sack bags, canvas, and mesh) as components of the construction.",
        "The building is divided into three parts: first-floor load bearing walls, a second floor made of mesh, and a roof. The first floor utilizes two forms of wall: one constituted by bags filled with readily available mud, rubble or debris, the other composed of used bottles. These walls not only form space on the ground floor but are also erected to act as the structure supporting the mesh layer. Due to the unpredictability of aftershocks, the building design foregoes a heavy roof. Instead, the roof is made from the original canvas used to package emergency supplies."

        "RehaBAMBOO is an institution which provides a healing process for people who are struggling with drug abuse. It incorporates three different timelines into one project.",
        "It starts with the medical and legal support of rehab patients, consisting of one week of intense medical watch, followed by six months of withdrawal care, and finally another six month program of security and recovering. The second timeline describes the life cycle of bamboo. In Taiwan, bamboo could take three years to grow into viable building material, and various preservation treatments take varying amounts of time. Lastly, a construction timeline is designed to integrate the former two phases, aligning the rehab treatment procedure with the cycle of nature."

            "Since studies have shown that the usual one-year rehab period is insufficient for a lasting withdrawal from material abuse, RehaBAMBOO proposes a three-year optional program for the rehab clients to self-build their temporal living units using bamboo.",
            "The training and building process happens during their first six months of residence, in a controlled workshop environment. The self-built houses become the clients’ living quarters for the remaining time of their stay under minimal security care, while they gradually adapt themselves back to society. The three-year stay coincides with the natural decay of bamboo material (without intensive chemical preservation treatment). At the end of the rehab program, the bamboo houses would collapse and be destroyed to mark the clients completion of this difficult and life-changing phase.",
            "RehaBAMBOO utilizes an existing 6-acre vacant site - a former military prison. About 20% of the site area is devoted to a medical and educational complex that provides ministration, care and training. Self-built houses compose about 40% of the site as a rehab village, while the rest of the area is devoted to the planting of the bamboo. The life and production of bamboo is studied and quantified as a parameter to organize the campus landscape: the planning area provides enough material for 300 living units to be build within a period of threes years. Water pools are also strategically designed and placed for preservation treatment and leisure.",
            "With new bamboos planted continuously, and mature plants taken down as building material, RehaBAMBOO forms a self-sustainable building, landscape and construction cycle."
